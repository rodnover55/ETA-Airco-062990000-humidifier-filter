# Filter for humidifier ETA Airco 062990000

## Description

For a long time I couldn't find a suitable water filter for this humidifier. This repository is a open scad project, which implements the filter. Maybe other humidifiers have the same mount, but I don't know about they.

## Instruction of using

- Open the cap.
- Pour a filter material into the container. I disassambled one of bought before and not suitable filters and use its filter material. The container must be filled above the inner cone.
- Close the cap.
- Install the assembled container to a humidifier.
- Use it.


## Parameters

Outer diameter: 50 mm

Height: 70 mm

Mount diameter: 36m
